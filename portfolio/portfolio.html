            <p>This personal portfolio acts as a demonstration of some of the most prominent tangible work I've completed throughout my education thus far. This site is purely informational. The primary purpose is to show my experience and qualifications in the various realms of construction. Renders and Physical models of my past work are displayed.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div class="about-me-and-photo">
        <p>My name is Jacob Moody. I'm studying Virtual Design and Construction at Brigham Young University - Idaho. In my time at BYU-I, I've become proficient with software including Revit, AutoCAD, Sketchup, Navisworks, Twin motion, and Lumion. My education has taught me an immense amount of information regarding construction and modeling that I was originally unfamiliar with. Even through my education I still consider myself a beginner and I feel that there is so much more I can learn. When I have free time, I love to draw portraits of my favorite characters. I also thoroughly enjoy going on beautiful hikes. Finally, I've recently become invested in learning and playing golf. </p>
