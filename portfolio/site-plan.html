      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For my personal website, I'd like to develop a portfolio that I can provide to employers. With this website I can show off the various construction-based projects and assignments I've completed during my time at BYUI. This will include plan drawings, software models, hand drawings, renders, etc.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this site is employers. Specifically the hiring department of construction companies that I will be applying to intern/work for. Showcasing projects I've worked on shows them my experience and competence.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>Professional Portfolio</h4>
         <p>This personal portfolio acts as a demonstration of some of the most prominent tangible work I've completed throughout my education thus far. This site is purely informational. The primary purpose is to show my experience and qualifications in the various realms of construction. Renders and Physical models of my past work are displayed.</p>
      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        My name is Jacob Moody. I'm studying Virtual Design and Construction at Brigham Young University - Idaho. In my time at BYU-I, I've become proficient with software including Revit, AutoCAD, Sketchup, Navisworks, Twin motion, and Lumion. My education has taught me an immense amount of information regarding construction and modeling that I was originally unfamiliar with. Even through my education I still consider myself a beginner and I feel that there is so much more I can learn. When I have free time, I love to draw portraits of my favorite characters. I also thoroughly enjoy going on beautiful hikes. Finally, I've recently become invested in learning and playing golf.

      </ul>
      <h3>Renders</h3>
      <h4>Presentation Graphics II</h4>
       <p>Renders are an integral part of any project in order to satisfy the needs of the owner. In this course students were tasked with developing their own custom vacation home set in Clark Fork Idaho. To begin students began by determining a client and the interests or preferences of their chosen client. Then, conceptual massing on Sketchup worked to display the base shape work of the project. The floor plans and 3D modeling were accomplished in Revit. Finally, detailed renderings of both the interior and exterior of the project were developed in Twinmotion. These renderings are a mockup of what the client could expect in regard to their project delivery and completion. </p>
      <h4>The A-Frame</h4>
      <p>
          For this semester long project, my client requested a getaway cabin where they could comfortably live during the winter months of the year. After thorough interviewing I determined that an A-frame cabin would fit the clients’ needs best. Throughout the project, I furthered my knowledge and comfortability in Twinmotion with this largely self-guided project. The rendering process was the most important aspect of the project. It served as a conceptual look of the final product before delivery. Both the interior and exterior renderings developed brought the space to life and demonstrated all the work poured into the project.

      </ul>
      <h3>Physical Models</h3>
      <h4>Presentation Graphics II</h4>
      <p>This model is a laser cut of the custom vacation home drafted in Presentation Graphics II. Students brought their elevation views from their developed plan set into AutoCad. Each facet of the house was separated on a page and were cut from wood boards using a laser cutter. Students glued together their houses on a foam base at either 1/4” scale or 3/16” scale. The physical model process took multiple hours to complete in both cutting and assembly time. The models were put on display in the hallway for the remainder of the course. </p>
      <h4>Framing Systems</h4>
      <p>
        The Framing Systems course is one that all Construction Management and VDC students take early on. During the lab portion of the class, students were split into groups of five to frame a scaled down house according to a set of plans. This project included real life scenarios including material takeoff, estimating, and inspections in order to create a structurally sound project. The project was entirely made of wood and needed to bear the load of all group members standing on the roof to pass. Beginning at just the base board, students were responsible for measuring and laying down footings and foundation walls. Floor joists and sheathing followed suit. All walls, including interior walls were framed and sheathed allowing necessary openings for the doors and windows. Finally, the roof followed the same process. The house sustained the weight of all group members and passed.
