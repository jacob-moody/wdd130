                    This model is a laser cut of the custom vacation home drafted in Presentation Graphics II. Students brought their elevation views from their developed plan set into AutoCad. Each facet of the house was separated on a page and were cut from wood boards using a laser cutter. Students glued together their houses on a foam base at either 1/4” scale or 3/16” scale. The physical model process took multiple hours to complete in both cutting and assembly time. The models were put on display in the hallway for the remainder of the course.

                   The Framing Systems course is one that all Construction Management and VDC students take early on. During the lab portion of the class, students were split into groups of five to frame a scaled down house according to a set of plans. This project included real life scenarios including material takeoff, estimating, and inspections in order to create a structurally sound project. The project was entirely made of wood and needed to bear the load of all group members standing on the roof to pass. Beginning at just the base board, students were responsible for measuring and laying down footings and foundation walls. Floor joists and sheathing followed suit. All walls, including interior walls were framed and sheathed allowing necessary openings for the doors and windows. Finally, the roof followed the same process. The house sustained the weight of all group members and passed.
