            <h2>Presentation Graphics II - Winter 2025</h2>
            <p>Renders are an integral part of any project in order to satisfy the needs of the owner. In this course students were tasked with developing their own custom vacation home set in Clark Fork Idaho. To begin students began by determining a client and the interests or preferences of their chosen client. Then, conceptual massing on Sketchup worked to display the base shape work of the project. The floor plans and 3D modeling were accomplished in Revit. Finally, detailed renderings of both the interior and exterior of the project were developed in Twinmotion. These renderings are a mockup of what the client could expect in regard to their project delivery and completion.</p>

       <h2>The A-Frame</h2>
       <p>For this semester long project, my client requested a getaway cabin where they could comfortably live during the winter months of the year. After thorough interviewing I determined that an A-frame cabin would fit the clients’ needs best. Throughout the project, I furthered my knowledge and comfortability in Twinmotion with this largely self-guided project. The rendering process was the most important aspect of the project. It served as a conceptual look of the final product before delivery. Both the interior and exterior renderings developed brought the space to life and demonstrated all the work poured into the project.</p>
