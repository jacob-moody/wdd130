    <h2>Jacob Moody</h2>
    <p>Hello there, my name is Jacob. I'm currently studying Virtual Design and Construction at BYU-I. I'm from Seattle, Washington. I have three older sisters. Some of my hobbies include drawing, hiking, and playing golf. When I'm not in school, I typically work at my local muni golf course.
    </p>
    <p> I'm taking this course to fulfill some of my general elective credits, however I'm also a little interested at being compitent when it comes to coding. I have a lot of friends and peers that know how to code, so I think it's about time I learn a thing or two. I really hope that I'll enjoy this course and that I'll be able to keep up with those that may already have some experience.</p>
